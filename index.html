    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This is a brief introduction about myself. I am passionate about web development and constantly learning new skills to enhance my projects.</p>
    
    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p>In this section, I will showcase some of the projects I have worked on. Each project represents a unique challenge and learning opportunity.</p>
    
    <h3>Project 1: Web Development</h3>
    <p>This project involved building a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helped me understand the fundamentals of front-end development.</p>
    
    <h3>Project 2: Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>In this project, I analyzed data sets using Python and visualized the results. It was a great experience that taught me about data manipulation and visualization.</p>
